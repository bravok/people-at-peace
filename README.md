# People At Peace

The next time you have the opportunity, go outside and look at the evening sky. Take time to look at the stars, and know that they are as real as you are.

You may be unable to do this for some time. The weather may not permit it. Your location may have no nighttime sky. You may be inprisoned. You may live deep in the forest, where the sky cannot be seen. You may be under the water on a journey.
