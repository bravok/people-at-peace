# People At Peace

The next time you have the opportunity, go outside and look at the evening sky. Take time to look at the stars, and know that they are as real as you are.

You may be unable to do this for some time. 
The weather may not permit it. 
Your location may have no nighttime sky. 
You may be inprisoned. 
You may live deep in the forest, 
where the sky cannot be seen. 
You may be under the water on a journey.
When the time is right for You, 
look at the clear night sky, 
and know that you belong here.

# About Peace

Everything you need to know to have Peace may be found inside of you and 
in Your relationships with Your Loved-Ones and Friends.

If You have no Loved Ones You have no Peace, but have depression.

If You have no Friends You have no Peace, but have anxiety.

This is the way of Homo Sapiens Sapien.

# Two Tales of Two Peoples

Everything you need to know can be found inside of you and 
in Your relationships with Your Loved-Ones and Friends.
