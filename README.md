# People At Peace

The next time you have the opportunity, go outside and look at the evening sky. Take time to look at the stars, and know that they are as real as you are.

You may be unable to do this for some time. 
The weather may not permit it. 
Your location may have no nighttime sky. 
You may be inprisoned. 
You may live deep in the forest, 
where the sky cannot be seen. 
You may be under the water on a journey.
When the time is right for You, 
look at the clear night sky, 
and know that you belong here.

# About Peace

Everything you need to know to have Peace may be found inside of you and 
in Your relationships with Your Loved-Ones and Friends.

If You have no Loved Ones You have no Peace, but have depression.

If You have no Friends You have no Peace, but have anxiety.

This is the way of Homo Sapiens Sapien.

# The Way

The way to Peace is illuminated with four Guidance.

## The First Guidance

The First Guidance is as follows:

There are four groups of people in the world with you.

The first group is your Self; past, present and future. It may seem that You your Self are only one person, but this is not the case. You are an infinite number of people, each marking the passage of time.

The second group are your Loved-Ones. These are the 10-12 people that are closest to you; your spouse, your child, your parent, their loved-ones. There are no more than 12. This is the way of Home Sapiens Sapien.

The third group are Your friends. These are the 29 to 31 people that you spend your time with; and their friends or loved ones. There are no more than 31 when you are In Order.

The fourth group are all of the Others. Your coworkers. The man in the car behind you. The woman and child sitting on the bus seat in front of you. Your Teacher. The Strangers.

## The Second Guidance

How to treat these people

## The Third Guidance

In Need, In Order, and In Excess

## The Fourth Guidance

When your group grows too large, divide it into two equal halves. This is the way of life. The healthy cell divides into two equal halves. The cancer fails to divide or does not divide equally. Cancer is deadly over time.

# Two Tales of Two Peoples

Everything you need to know can be found inside of you and 
in Your relationships with Your Loved-Ones and Friends.
